# introduction
	This is part one our version control system, which only implements the
	create repo command, which functions under only certain conditions.

# Usage instructions
## External Requirements
	This program requires a python instalation to run.  Further, these
	instructions assume a unix-like environment.

## Installation and Setup
	This doesn't need installed in any particular location.  Additionally,
	this software can be installed by using the git `clone` command with the
	URL `https://github.com/csulb-cmw/repo343` as the first argument.

## Usage
	The create repo command can be invoked using
	`python \path\to\script\directory\repo343 create` or 
	`python \path\to\script\directory\repo343 init`
	and should be invoked while in the root directory of the project to be
	commited to the new repo.  If permission to execute the file is given via
	the `chmod +x \path\to\script\directory\repo343` then they python portion
	of the previous commands can be ommited.
